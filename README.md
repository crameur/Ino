All-in-One sensor for Aquaponics systems

In this repo, you will find all the elements needed to build your own aquaponics sensors.
This will give you the ability to monitor :
- the pH and conductivity of your tank, the water height and the water temperature.

This project was made using an arduino Nano board and a Nextion display.
